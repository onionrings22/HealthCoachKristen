<h1>Meet Coach Kristen</h1>

    Kristen is a really good health coach. Her clients think she's great.
    She has all kinds of training and she's in perfect shape. I need this
    to be long so I can see how the text behaves with the image inline. Words
    make it longer, so I'm going to put lots and lots of words and then
    some more words until eventually I see if this is going to work or not.
    I'm not sure exactly how many words I need so I'm going to keep going
    to make sure that I have enough words to get below the picture.<hr>

    I am an American Council on Exercise (ACE) Certified Health Coach.
    The ACE Health Coach Certification is accredited by the National Commission
    for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the same body that accredits certifications
    for athletic trainers, nurse practitioners, occupational therapists,
    registered dietitians, and many other health professions.

    I am also a Level 2 Certified CrossFit coach and a CrossFit Mobility and
    Movement Trainer. I started coaching CrossFit in 2012 at CrossFit Intensify
    in Eugene, Oregon. I joined the team at Arbor CrossFit in 2014 after moving
    to Boise. In addition to coaching regular CrossFit classes,  myprimary focus
    at both organizations was getting people started or reengaged with their health
    and fitness.
