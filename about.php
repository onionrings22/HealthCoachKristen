<h1>About Coach Kristen</h1>

    Kristen is a really good health coach. Her clients think she's great.
    She has all kinds of training and she's in perfect shape. I need this
    to be long so I can see how the text behaves with the image inline. Words
    make it longer, so I'm going to put lots and lots of words and then
    some more words until eventually I see if this is going to work or not.
    I'm not sure exactly how many words I need so I'm going to keep going
    to make sure that I have enough words to get below the picture.<hr>
